            SimSpace is the visionary yet practical platform for measuring how
            your security system responds under actual, sustained attack. We are
            moving global business from total denial to full preparedness.

          <p>
            The principles and methods behind SimSpace were born in the crucible
            of the Department of Defense. They call it "train like you fight."
            We have advanced and refined those simulation skills — leveraging
            Red, Blue and White Teams — for the everyday realities of enterprise
            companies. We predict to protect.

            The gap between what security systems promise in their marketing,
            and what they deliver in action, is real. Is dangerous. And can be
            closed. With SimSpace you can put on your eyeglasses of the future,
            and watch your network behave when subjected to a variety of
            real-world attacks.
